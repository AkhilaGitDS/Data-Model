1. A Single table is already a data model, although in its simplest form. 
2. Even with single table, we must define granularity of data. Picking the right granularity makes calculations much more simple to modeller.
3. The difference between working with a single table and multiple tables, in multiple tables - many tables are joined by relationship.
4. In a relationship between two tables, there is _One side_ and _Many side_ indicating how many rows we are likely to find if we follow the relationship. Eg: One Class has many Students.
5. The Relationship cannot be identified if the target table dont have primary key with unique values that can be used to identify a single row.
6. A normalised model is a data model where the data is stored in a compressed way, avoiding duplicates in different rows and this structure invloves more(>=2) number of tables.
7. A denormalised model has more duplicate values but has fewer tables.
8. Normalised models are very much used for OLTP(Transactional) ; whereas denormalised models are used in OLAP (Analysis).
9. Star Schema is a typical analytical model which classifies each entity in the model as either a facts(events) or a dimensions(informational assets).
