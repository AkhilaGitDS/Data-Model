**Understand the importance of naming objects:**

Word of advice with naming conventions while building datawarehouse is to use readable names that clearly identify the dimension or fact table. Simple set of rules for table and column naming are ::
  + Table name for dimensions should consist of only the business asset name, in singular or plural form. eg: Customer
  + Use casing to separate the words, if the business asset contain multiple word. eg: ProductCategory
  + Facts, table name should consist of the business name for the fact, which is always plural. eg: Purchases
  + Avoid too long table/column names.
  + Avoid too short table/column names.
  + The key to dimension is the dimension name followed by the key. eg: The primary key of Customer is Customerkey.
