**Reason for Data Model:**
Sometimes computing the numbers become too complicated through formulas. Its always a best practice to fix the data model before we apply formulas to compute. we all must learn data modeling if we want to improve our analytical abilities and if we like to focus on making the right decision instead of finding the right complex formula.
