Many-to-many relationships are main concept while analysing data. Usually they are treated as problematic because many-to-many relationships tend to make the model more complex than normal. But they should be treated as opportunity instead. Actually, its easy to handle many-to-many relationships and only need to learn basic technique and use it at our convenience.

Below are some reasons why many-to-many are more complex than other kind relationships:
* Many-to-many typically generates non-additive calculations
* Depending on the size of the many-to-many filtering, performance might be an issue like traversal of two relationships in opposite directions might become expensive.

_Understanding bidirectional pattern:_
By definition, a filter on a table moves from the one side to the many side, but it does not move from the many side to the one side. we can solve this scenario by setting the distribution of the filter on the relationship between bridge table and other table as bidirectional. Alternatively, we can use CROSSFILTER function as parameter to activate bidirectional filter. By performance wise both behave the same.

_Understanding non-additivity:_
Measures aggregated through a many-to-many relationship are non-additive, which is not an error in the model instead it is the nature of many-to-many that makes these relationships non-additive. While handling this kind of situation, we need to be aware of its nature and act accordingly.

_Cascading Many-to-many:_
Chains of many-to-many relationships are called as cascading many-to-many. The data model with two bridge tables, where the model becomes fully functional and we can produce reports. There is nothing complex in a bridge table that links dimensions, and data model looks somewhat easier to analyze.
