Many-to-many relationships are main concept while analysing data. Usually they are treated as problematic because many-to-many relationships tend to make the model more complex than normal. But they should be treated as opportunity instead. Actually, its easy to handle many-to-many relationships and only need to learn basic technique and use it at our convenience.

Below are some reasons why many-to-many are more complex than other kind relationships:
* Many-to-many typically generates non-additive calculations
* Depending on the size of the many-to-many filtering, performance might be an issue like traversal of two relationships in opposite directions might become expensive.
