Here time is the target for analysis, means computing the number of working hours in a period, the number of employees working for different time frames for various projects and so on. Durations in fact tables are typical events where they extend their effect for some time. So all in all, what we store in fact table is not the date of the event instead the point in time when the event started. 

Concepts like time, duration and periods are main focus in this topic. Here more of analysing the facts with duration happens and some of slicing data by time happens.
