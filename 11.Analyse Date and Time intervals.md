Here time is the target for analysis, means computing the number of working hours in a period, the number of employees working for different time frames for various projects and so on. Durations in fact tables are typical events where they extend their effect for some time. So all in all, what we store in fact table is not the date of the event instead the point in time when the event started. 

Concepts like time, duration and periods are main focus in this topic. Here more of analysing the facts with duration happens and some of slicing data by time happens. 

Date and Time must be stored in separate columns, is best solution to fulfill different customers needs. 

Aggregating simple intervals is easy. So based on our analytical needs we should try to reduce the cardinality of the facts and the Time column too. 

The main takeaway is when ever we struggle to bring up any complex report, then it is a very good indicator that we might need to work on the model. Although is is true that the model should not be built for a single report, it is also true that a good model is the key to an efficient solution.
