Time is a special dimension and should be created in a correct way with some special considerations. Adding a date dimension to the model makes the code much easier to write.
We always need a dimension to correctly slice two fact tables at once, for the same reason we have date dimension too. Using columns in the fact table makes the coding of time-intelligence calculations much more complex, whereas using a date dimension makes calculations much easier to write.
