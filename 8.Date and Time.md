Time is a special dimension and should be created in a correct way with some special considerations. Adding a date dimension to the model makes the code much easier to write.
We always need a dimension to correctly slice two fact tables at once, for the same reason we have date dimension too. Using columns in the fact table makes the coding of time-intelligence calculations much more complex, whereas using a date dimension makes calculations much easier to write.

We can achieve below using date dimension:
+ Can improve the performance of the queries.
+ Can create a model that is simpler to navigate.
+ Can simplify the writing of measures.
+ Always using time dimension yields only advantage. 
+ Loading the Date table multiple times removes ambiguity from the model.
+ Using the same dimensions to filter two fact tables makes the model easier to use.

The time dimension is useful to generate reports that show sales divided by hour.
