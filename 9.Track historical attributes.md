In laymans term, Data which changes over time are called _Slowly Changing Dimension_. For some reports, it is useful to track both the current and the historical value of some attributes like address, sales and performance and so on. These attributes belong to dimensions and they typically change slowly over time and needs to be tracked. 

Professionally mostly used Slowly Changing Dimensions are : 
* SCD 1 / Type 1, 
* SCD 2 / Type 2,
* And very rarely SCD 3 / Type 3. 

**SCD 1 / Type 1 :**
The value stored in a dimension is always the current one. if we find that something changed in the processing of our model, we simply replace the old value with the new one. We store only the recent value of any column. Since we do no actually track any variations, Type 1 SCDs do not really look like SCDs. 

**SCD 2 / Type 2 :**
Type 2 SCDs are _true_ SCDs. Here we store the information many times, once for each version. For example, a customer changes his or her address, then we will store two rows for that customer, one row with old address and other with new address. The rows in the fact table will point to the right version of the customer.

Main points to consider about SCDs:

+ Current and the historical value both are very important. We will use both based on kind of insight we want to retrieve by querying the model. A good implementation of SCD should keep both the historical and the current value for every single record.
+ While the term is _Slowly Changing Dimensions,_ the dimensions themselves do not actually change. Rather, it is one or more of the attributes of the dimensions that change. 

One of the consideration with regard to SCDs is:
It is very useful to know how to spot this very small difference between calculating the number of customers and the number of versions. Recognizing these small details will help very much in our data modelling and also help to identify when a number or total is wrong.  

The presence of an SCD changes the granularity of both the dimension and the fact table. Changing the granularity involves several actions to build the correct model.We need to change the query of both the dimension and the fact table so their granularity matches. And we cannot update the granularity of one table without updating the granularity of the other one. if not, the relationship will not work correctly.

Things to keep in mind while loading SCDs:

+ The new granularity of the SCD depends on the attributes of the dimension that were expected to change over time.
+ Modifying the dimension for right granularity requires complex queries.
+ Need to modify the fact table based on new dimension by performing lookup for easy computation. All in all the slowly changing attributes were used to define the granularity.

**Rapidly Changing Dimensions:**

Attribute that always changes each year which is for example age and we cannot handle age as SCD. Here the fact is, the whole dimension does not change. Rather, one attribute of the dimension changes. If an attribute changes too often, the best option is to store the attribute as dimension by itself and remove attribute from main dimension/ original dimension. Data model is much simpler than fully featured SCD.
