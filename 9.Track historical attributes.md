In laymans term, Data which changes over time are called _Slowly Changing Dimension_. For some reports, it is useful to track both the current and the historical value of some attributes like address, sales and performance and so on. These attributes belong to dimensions and they typically change slowly over time and needs to be tracked. 

Professionally mostly used Slowly Changing Dimensions are : 
* SCD 1 / Type 1, 
* SCD 2 / Type 2,
* And very rarely SCD 3 / Type 3. 

**SCD 1 / Type 1 :**
The value stored in a dimension is always the current one. if we find that something changed in the processing of our model, we simply replace the old value with the new one. We store only the recent value of any column. Since we do no actually track any variations, Type 1 SCDs do not really look like SCDs.
