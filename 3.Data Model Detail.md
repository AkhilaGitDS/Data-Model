**Data Model bit more detail:**
  Instead of storing all information in one table with many columns, its always a good method to break simple piece of information into small tables with some columns and connect all small tables with the reference keys. 
  
  Two main reasons for doing so is it reduces the size on disk of the model by avoiding repetition of the same data. if at some point we must update some row, then we only need to do it once on the single row that stores it. All the other tables will automatically use the new value through the relationship.
  
 **Data Model design technique:**
 
   _Normalisation-_
   An attribute when it stored in a separate table and replaced with a key which points to that table. 
   
   _Denormalisation-_
   Storing all attributes in the same table where it belongs to. When a model is denormalised, the same attribute appears multiple times. 
   
Highly normalised structures are usually of OLTP(Online Transactional Processing) systems and these system are designed to use the least amount of space. 

A Simple entity like the Product might be stored in 10 or 20 different tables, then all tables linked through relationship. This is called " Well designed Data Model".
