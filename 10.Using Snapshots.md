A _Snapshot_ is a kind of table that is often used in the modelling of data. Time plays vital role in generating snapshot table. Its not a fact but it is a measure taken at some point in time. Snapshot is nothing but it is a measure of what was available at that time. 

Types of snapshots:
+ Natural Snapshots: These are the data sets in which data is by its nature in the form of a snapshot. Eg: Summer temperature is a natural snapshot.
+ Derived Snapshots: These are the data sets that look like snapshots, because we tend to think of them as snapshots. Eg: Daily transaction is aggregated as monthly balance of current account.
