A _Snapshot_ is a kind of table that is often used in the modelling of data. Time plays vital role in generating snapshot table. Its not a fact but it is a measure taken at some point in time. Snapshot is nothing but it is a measure of what was available at that time. 

Types of snapshots:
+ Natural Snapshots: These are the data sets in which data is by its nature in the form of a snapshot. Eg: Summer temperature is a natural snapshot.
+ Derived Snapshots: These are the data sets that look like snapshots, because we tend to think of them as snapshots. Eg: Daily transaction is aggregated as monthly balance of current account. 

Points to remember about snapshot:
* A snapshot table is not like a regular fact table, which means values cannot be summed over time. Rather, they must use non-additive formulas like FROMDATE, TODATE, LASTDATE so on.
* Snapshot granularity everyday would be so large and will be bad impact on performance. 
* Precompute the information about the dates present in snapshot using calculated column in the date table, which results in much better performance.
* Using derived snapshots, We cannot generate subtotals by aggregating with SUM and we cannot slice by any other attribute . 
Above points applies to almost all kinds of snapshots.

Snapshots are useful tools to reduce the size of a table at the cost of granularity but comes with high complexity in the model. Instead of simple SUM, snapshots almost require aggregations without subtotals(fully avoid subtotals). The granularity of snapshots is always different from the granularity of normal fact tables.
