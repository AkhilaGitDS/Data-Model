**Granularity:**

  The higher the granularity means which are able to perform more detailed analysis. Picking the correct granularity level is always challenging. We must increase the granularity to create reports at the wanted details. Defining the correct granularity in a single-table data model is always complicated with all the information in the same table.
  
  Excel users mostly use single-table data models because this was the only option available to build PivotTables(A PivotTable is a powerful tool to calculate, summarize, and analyze data that lets us see comparisons, patterns, and trends in our data.)
  
  Granularity in the multiple-table data model, to some extent, easier to solve but bit more complex to understand when compared to single-table data model. In fact, granularity is a concept that is applied to a table, not to the data model as a whole. Granularity is not a problem as long as we store the information in the correct table. 
  
  Granularity is defined by the level at which the dimensions are linked to the fact table.
