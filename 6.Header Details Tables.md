Header/Detail table model come in use when we want to mix reports that aggregate numbers at the two different levels. This model/ structure is generated on top of our fact tables that says whenever we have some relationships between two fact tables. Here header and detail, both tables are fact tables, meanwhile the header table acts as a dimension for the detail table. 

For better granularity its good to denormalise the metric in header table to detail table, thinking header as being a dimension. Since it is a dimension that has relationship with fact table via other dimensions - now the model is changed from 'Header/detail table model' to 'snowflake'. Snowflakes are not perfect option for performance and analysis but are reasonable from a modelling point of view. 

To Summarize about header/detail table model:
+ The header table acts a both a dimension and a fact table, simultaneously. It acts as a dimension to slice the detail, and acts as a fact table when we need to summarize values at the header granularity.
+ Bidirectional filter or many-to many pattern should be activated to summarize values from header related to the detail.
+ Should denormalise the value at the right granularity to make the model easier to use.
