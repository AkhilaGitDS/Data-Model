The logical structure is built by the developer to match a requirement. 

From a beginner’s point of view:

1 or more “tables” of data, with 1 or more “columns” (also known as “fields”) in each table.

Each table corresponds with a “data entity” e.g. a ‘Person’. Each column corresponds with a “property” of that entity, e.g. ‘Name’

Each “row” in the table is an instance of that entity, in the example each row would correspond to a person. So the table ‘Person’ might have a column ‘Name’, with a row that contained the value “Joe” in that column, on that row.

If there is more than one table, there is often a “Relationship” that joins them. For example, two tables “Family” and “Person”, there will be a “Relationship” that joins each “Person” to a “Family”.

That’s the most basic level of logical structuring.
