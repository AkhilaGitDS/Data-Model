Multiple Fact tables which are not related to each other. Using multiple fact tables is not an issue if the model is correctly designed and everything works fine. Its more challenging when the fact tables are not correctly related to intermediate dimensions.

Excessive level of denormalisation are impossible to relate to each other with in two fact tables. So as a solution, we can re-create a star schema out of the unrelated tables to restore proper functionality of the model.
