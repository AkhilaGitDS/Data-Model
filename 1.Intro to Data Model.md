**Reason for Data Model:**

Sometimes computing the numbers become too complicated through formulas. Its always a best practice to fix the data model before we apply formulas to compute. we all must learn data modeling if we want to improve our analytical abilities and if we like to focus on making the right decision instead of finding the right complex formula. 

Related columns which are stored in different tables can be reachable and pulled data by relationships in data model.

**What is Data Model? :**

A Data Model is just a set of tables linked by relationships. Multiple tables data model is more interesting than a single table data model because multiple tables data model is more powerful and interesting to analyse data.
  
  _Some facts about a relationship in a data-model:_
  * Always relationship starts from source table and reaches the target table.
  * Source table is also called _Many side_ of the relationship and Target table is known as _One side_ of the relationships. 
  * A _Foreign Key_ is a column that points to a _Primary Key_ in another table. 
  * Once a relationship between multiple tables are in place, we can slice the value from one table by using column in another table.
