**Star Schema:**

Thinking about any particular business, mostly we are able to clearly separate between business assets and events. This separation between assets and events lead to data-modelling technique know as Star Schema. 

Star Schema has 2 main categories : 

_Dimensions:_ A Dimension is an informational asset, like a employee, a customer etc. Dimensions have attributes.

_Facts:_ A Fact is an event includes some dimensions. Facts have metrics, which are number that we can aggregate to get insights from our business. 

Star schemas are easy to read, understand and use. We use dimensions to slice and dice the data, where as we use fact tables to aggregate numbers. Today star schema are considered the standard way of representing analytical models as they have become very popular in the datawarehouse industry. 

Its very important to get used to star schemas because in the business intelligence(BI) world, terms related to star schems are used very frequently. By nature, fact tables are larger in size and dimensions tables are small ones. 

Fact tables are related to dimensions, but dimensions should not have relationship among them. If dimensions are related in a schema, then they create _Ambiguity_. We should denormalise the relevant columns who are all creating ambiguity. When the ambiguity creating table is denormalised, then the table is not part data model, instead columns of that table are created in both relavent tables. Data modelers, must avoid ambiguity at all costs.

**SnowFlake:**

A _Snowflake_ is contrast of Star Schema where a dimension is not related directly to the fact table, rather it is related through another dimension. To some sense, _Snowflake_ break the rule of dimensions being connected together, but a dimension does not group together with any unrrelated dimension or fact and won't create any ambiguity which is totally fine with Data Model. 

Apart from small performance degradation, there is nothing wrong with snowflakes. Its good to avoid denormalizing the columns / tables which is far from fact table compare to close by columns / table. 

Star Schema are almost always the better way to represent our data. It might not be perfect, but it will be close to perfect enough to be a good solution.
