**Data Model bit more detail:**
  Instead of storing all information in one table with many columns, its always a good method to break simple piece of information into small tables with some columns and connect all small tables with the reference keys. 
  
  Two main reasons for doing so is it reduces the size on disk of the model by avoiding repetition of the same data. if at some point we must update some row, then we only need to do it once on the single row that stores it. All the other tables will automatically use the new value through the relationship.
